## Projects

### Estimation of Non-Stationary Linear Time Series
-  Initiated during my tenure as a Research Assistant and concluded as the Bachelor's Thesis for my B.Sc in Financial Mathematics and Actuarial Science. Attained a final grade of ***75%***
-  Developing estimation methods by approximating ARMA process as finite AR processes.
-  Investigated
estimation of purely explosive and mixed root model coefficients with respect to independent hyperparameters, proposing hypotheses surrounding convergence and consistency.
-  **Key Skills and Tools:** R, Latex, Time Series Analysis, Research Design, Communication, Presentation
-  **Repository:** [https://github.com/clerycolm/Bachelors-Thesis]

### Chess Game Results Analysis and Classification
- The analysis explores chess's complexities and the factors affecting game outcomes for titled players.
- Dataset comprises 20,000+ games and was collected from Chess.com using a python web scraping script.
- Generated insights into factors affecting game outcomes via exploratory data analysis.
- Generated Classification models using Multinomial Logistic Regression, Random Forests, KNN and SVM models. Achieved a test accuracy score of ***91%***.
- **Key Skills and Tools:** Python (scikit-learn, statsmodels, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), Web Scraping ( Beautiful Soup, selenium ), Multiclass Classification, Exploratory Data Analysis
-  **Repository:** [https://github.com/clerycolm/Chess-Games-Analysis]

### Forecasting Residential Property Value in Ireland
- Prompted by Ireland's housing and living cost challenges, this project models changes in Residential Property Transaction Value in Ireland since 2010.
- This project focuses on the fundamental of fitting time series models, conducting diagnostics, making forecasts, and analysing the implications of the forecasted values.
- This project was completed as part of undergraduate Time Series module focuses on time series modelling.
- **Key Skills and Tools:** R, Time Series Analysis
- **Repository:** [https://github.com/clerycolm/Property-Value-Forecasting]
